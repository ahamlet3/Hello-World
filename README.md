# Hello-World
This is me learning the world of github. First I am tasked with the intro guide. 
then I want to see if I can merge my current projects on
onto this platform.

Insert A paragraph about myself.
Shortly, I am a Mechanical Engineering Graduate from Georgia Tech. 
I've always been interested in coding but never tasked myself to learn languages appropriately. 
So now I want to utilize github to document my learning of language(s) for personal projects and friends.
